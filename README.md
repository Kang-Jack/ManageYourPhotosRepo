# ManageYourPhotosRepo

## Project back ground:

If you like take photos, you may backup your photo in different places/devices. Then how to make them consistent everywhere, may borther you just like me:

I like to manage my photo in my laptop, and process them with a desktop, and also make a backup in usb disk... when i pick up and delete photo in one place.  I hanve to keep updating in all place ,otherwise i have to handle the difference during the restore and merge.


## Solution:
The tool allow you make a selected photo list file by auto scan your working folder (can detecte the subfolder as well), then can clean up your other place based on the selected photo list file.

### All selected photo will be kept, the removed photo will be moved to a 'remove' sub folder. you can manully check them later.

## Supports
Windows and MacOS system are supported
